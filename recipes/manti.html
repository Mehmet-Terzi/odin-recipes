        <h2>Turkish tortellini with meat filling</h2>
        <p>served with garlic yogurt and a butter sauce with paprika powder. It is really prepared very quickly.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g Manti (Turkish dumplings/tortellini)</li>
            <li>400g natural yogurt</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika powder sweet</li>
            <li>optional : parsley as topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the manti. Turn the heat down a bit and let them steep in the hot water for about 8-10 minutes. If the water boils too much, they will fall apart on you.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, mix the natural yogurt with 2 cloves of grated garlic and salt it properly.</li>
            <li>When the manti are cooked, heat a small pan with the butter. When the butter starts to foam, add the paprika powder and then remove the pan from the heat fairly quickly. You really have to be careful that you don't burn the sauce, but that the butter is still nice and foamy.</li>
        </ol>
