            <li>Lamb belly bacon you can either directly at the butcher with the minced meat through the meat grinder or cut very small and add.</li>
            <li>For the dough, mix all ingredients together, knead into a yeast dough and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>From the dough you can form small balls and roll them out as big as a cake plate.</li>

            <li>Now you can put one or two tablespoons of the filling on each ball and spread it with a fork.</li>
            <li>Of course, the most important thing is to bake the Turkish pizza one by one in a pizza oven.
                Have fun with the re-baking.</li>
